1. Game Rules
-------------
    To complete the level you must push each of the boxes into the storage
area. The storage area is marked by different color of the floor. You cannot
push more than one box at a time. You cannot pull boxes, you can only push.

	SOKO3D.IMG - Graphics data for Sokoban 3D
	SOKO3D.DAT - default levels for Sokoban 3D
	SOKO3D.TXT - this file

Command line format:
        SOKO3D          - start Sokoban 3D with default levels (SOKO3D.DAT)
        SOKO3D file.dat - start Sokoban 3D with custom levels

4. Level format
---------------
    You are given the possibility to design your own levels.
    The .dat file is a usual text file that can be edited with any plain text
editor. The format of the .dat file should be obvious from looking at any
example .dat file. Nevertheless a few notes:
    3.1. The level dimensions are currently limited to 200x200 (could you dare
         to design such a huge level?)
    3.2. Level numbering must be (001) to maximum (999). The number of each
         level must equal the number of the previous level plus 1.
    3.3. Do not use optional spaces and empty lines in .dat file. In fact
         there is no such option.
    3.4. Map legend: <space> - empty cell, # - wall, $ - box, . - target cell,
         * - box on target cell, @ - player ini pos.

5. Known bugs
-------------
    1. In fullscreen mode palette sometimes not correctly restored when
switching back to Soko3D from some other app. The workaround for this
problem is to switch to Windowed mode then back to fullscreen.

6. Acknowledgements
-------------------
    .dat file format is .lev file format of WinSoko by Phade Software (much
compatible with many other versions of Sokoban)
    soko3d.dat contains levels from WinSoko
